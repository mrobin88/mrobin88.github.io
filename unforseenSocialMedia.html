In the earliest years of social networks, companies had a simple goal; to allow users an easier way to keep up with the lives of their friends and family. However, social media has become much more complex due to technological advances and the ability to collect massive amounts of data about people. By collecting and selling user information these companies have the ability to make immense profits, thereby convoluting what is most important to their mission. These companies are now motivated by what kind of profit they can make rather than what kind of connections they can provide to users. But, The question at hand is; Have social-media companies lost their way from the goal of connecting people?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Early social media companies did have more of a goal towards genuinely connecting people. Early companies that incorporated social media and networking such as AOL facilitated interactions were based mainly around chatting, either with individuals or chat rooms which people could form around common interests. It encouraged an online culture of connecting in a personal way. Over time, companies like Myspace and Facebook came to the market bringing the evolution of social media into the more modern form we know today where users would curate a profile with photos and add large numbers of friends. Chatting online with individual people became less of a focus and more so was geared towards adding large groups of people who you may or may not engage with at all. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This model of collecting many people in one place along, with technological advances has given these companies the ability to collect massive amounts data about its users. It has compromised the original, more innocent meaning of what it means to interact on a social network. One could also say that now its aim is to disconnect people. If people are kept online, this is more advantageous for these companies than if people use it as a tool to discover others they might like to meet offline in the real-world. Profits are only maximized by keeping users on the platform. The companies have tactics that draw people to stay online, therefore deterring people from making real-world connections.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">This heavy investment in retaining users has resulted in billions of dollars spent on information warfare. It&rsquo;s hard not to question what the motives are of this company when such massive amounts of money are tied to users. A prime example of how social media has lost its way is in the recent scandal involving the United States presidential election. </span><span class="c7">In the article Cloak And Data, in the Mother Jones publication they discuss how Facebook sold massive amounts of user information to Cambridge Analytica, that was used to sway the 2016 presidential elections in the united states. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c1">Campaign managers and strategists are willing to pay millions of dollars to better understand voters. Cambridge Analytica offered data on more than 230 million people such as income, what kind of car they own, education level, drugs or medicines they have used and their religious beliefs and affiliations. In addition, they gathered psychological data from social-media profiles to conduct their own research with surveys that were sent out to people on Facebook. They tailored these surveys to specific profiles, crafting them in such a way that would make users more likely to complete it. It has been said many times that data companies and internet companies know us better than we know ourselves, and in a way one could say we are not using the platform but that it is using us for their gain. This amount of information is only available to this degree because of the previously mentioned tactics in keeping people using the platform.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This information is valuable, the data collected from Facebook users was used to manipulate voters and target them to go out and vote for a particular candidate. What makes matters worse is that it also threatened national security being that Cambridge Analytica is a company based in the United Kingdom, and the information was sold to Russian companies. Foreign entities are now looking at these tools as something much more than a network of friends just keeping in-touch. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">All of the new changes happening at these evolving social media companies may have some advantages. People are now able to keep records of information about past events so that it is accessible for the future. There is no need to worry about heavy book binders filled with family photos or lugging around a file cabinet with past conversations and documents. The advances in file storage have been a good thing for the users efficiency. At the end of the day the internet and computers are just a collection of files and data systematically organized. However, issues arise when all of this information costs us the right to our privacy and when it&rsquo;s used, sometimes without our knowledge as seen with Cambridge Analytica, to manipulate results or make a profit along with potential other unforeseen consequences. I think a good question to ask is, at what cost do we get access to these really powerful networks that allow us to have rapid access to information. What are the trade-offs?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Users willingly connect with friends and family signing away most of their rights to privacy in a terms of service agreement. The problem is that no one knows what they are signing when they sign up with a digital service. I referenced some friends of mine who work as security experts at social-media and internet companies who both stated &ldquo;No, nobody actually reads terms of service agreements.&rdquo; It would take the average person two months to read and understand all amendments in a terms of service contract. Social media and other technology companies goals are to protect themselves and comply with regulations. However, along with this they strip away user rights so in the event that data is compromised the individual users have minimal protections. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Since it is a well known fact that the average social-media user does not reads the terms of service agreement, courts do not recognize terms of service as a legally binding agreement. When asking experts about terms of service user agreements they replied with, </span><span class="c7">&ldquo; It is my life, all I do is make updates to terms of service and user agreements.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span class="c7">..&rdquo;Mainly these companies have to comply with countries and international governing bodies around the world,&rdquo;...</span><span class="c7">Failure to comply with regulations in the European Union can lead seizure of capital, and or out right shutting us down.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Making sure that these companies comply with international governing bodies has come along way from just a simple attempt to connect people with each other. Social-media and tech companies are adding and redefining what they provide as a service in the form of a legally flimsy service agreement.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The challenge for smaller social-media and internet companies is that companies cannot compete if their goals are oriented around simply connecting people. The big companies have employed many people where their main job is to understand human behavior. These behaviors such as likes, reposts, following and comments are like currency. When you have a positive interaction with an online element, the human brain feels rewarded because it releases a squirt of pleasurable neurotransmitters. This activation in the reward center of the brain is something that marketers and web content creators are very keen on. Companies are more concerned with making sure users come back for another hit of dopamine and less interested in connecting people these days.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Social media is now also a primary way the people get their news. It was not foreseen that users would post stories and post updates in the early days of these networks. This phenomenon is just part of the internet nowadays and feels natural. Long over are the days where a dozen or so news outlets run the global news empire. With social media like youtube channels and podcasts everyone is having a say on what is news. Journalists are being challenged on how they can verify a credible news source. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Over the years advances in computer technology, smartphones and all types of computers have become more powerful. It has implications on how humans are now interacting with computers and these social media companies. The social networks on one to many dynamic and can have a profound impact on society. One person can influence many people. We are all tethered to our devices, and the speed in which our devices respond is instantaneous. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">It has been observed that the number of transistors on a central processing unit doubles every two years, and the cost per transistor is halved. This trend is known as Moore&rsquo;s Law which was first observed in 1965. It is an interesting time to be looking at computer human interaction because this trend is coming to an end. Computer manufacturers and architects are looking at new devices and ways to redesign computer architecture. They have started looking at what new ways people are shaping technology by finding new ways to use these tools that were not seen when computer architecture was first defined. This seems to be the same trend that we are seeing with social media. These instances are happening parallel to one another unforeseen changes in computer architecture and the changes in how social-media has evolved and become what it is today. Because many of these changes and trends have been unforseen, we will have to wait and see what the future holds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Annotated Bibliography</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">P at cloudflare </span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">discussed issues having to do with terms of service, and government regulations.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">T at Apple </span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">discussed computer architecture and the challenges in making computers faster.
