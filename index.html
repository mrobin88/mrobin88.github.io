	<p>First off when you visit a website of a person you know you probably wonder why and how did they make it.</p>
	<p> Why?: I made this website because I wanted to demystify aspects of the Internet and what it means to be on the Internet and webistes.</p>
	<br>
	<p> How?: I bought a domain name from namecheap.com, learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. brainstormed what content I wanted to have on my site. 
			googled all the questions I had when I ran into issues. and used Github to host the code. probably watched some tutorials on the Tube of Yous. </p>
		
	
		<p> Websites are a file structure the files are indexed kind of like a file system on your computer. for example you have a 
		file folder called "Downloads". downloads lives on the path<br>
		<div align="left">
			<h2> /home/matthew/Downloads<h2> </div> 
				just like a website
		<br>
		<div align="center"><h2>mattrobin.me/cool/dude<h2></div>
		that structure is refered to as a tree scructure with parent child relationship. "cool" is the parent to dude, so that makes "dude" the child.
			
		It helps to peel back a layer to see things differently. We dont need to know how things exactly work use them this is called abstaction.
		I wanted to peel back a layer of my abstracted use of computers and the Internet so I built a website.</p>
